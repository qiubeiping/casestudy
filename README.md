Please refer to the 2016 dataset at: https://www.cms.gov/OpenPayments/Explore-the- Data/Dataset-Downloads.html  Can you create a simple web program, such that when we type in the name (FIRST MIDDLE LAST) of a physician from the 2016 dataset, the program drops a pin on a map of the US, highlighting the exact location of where the physician is based.
You can click this link https://mynodejsmap.herokuapp.com/index.html to direct to the web page. And actually this is supported by Heroku app.
